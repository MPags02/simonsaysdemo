# Description
This is a short simon says program. A color will flash, and a corresponding sound will play. The user will then have to click that same color. The program will then play that same color, and another random one after that.
The user will then have to mimic that pattern.

# How to run 
This game was created using Python and PyGame. The Ide used during creation was IDLE (version 3.10). I used a laptop operating on the Windows OS during its creation. So the user just needs a computer and all of the files in the right place in order to run the game.
